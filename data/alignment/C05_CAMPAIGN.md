# C05 CAMPAIGN — ACI Course 5 (How Karma Works), full-depth alignment

Opened 2026-09-05, immediately after C04 closed (198/198, 2026-09-04),
under Adam's standing order to scan C05 and then C06. Briefs are the
course-parametrised set in `docs/alignment_briefs/`; the task names the course.

Standing rules (Adam): GMR's English stays VERBATIM, typos flagged never
corrected; nothing binding without human review; every batch records its
producing model (propose: Claude Opus 5 · reconcile/refute: Claude Fable
5.1); completeness is proved by the builder's COVERAGE GATE, never asserted
in prose; a reconciler's deliverable is a spec FILE that exited 0.

## Course shape (spine scan, 511 segments)
- **1–21: the liturgical opening, BYTE-IDENTICAL to C03:1–21** (and so to
  C04:1–21) in both columns; 21/21 verified by SQL join at open. As in C04,
  c5p1–c5p7 are the landed c3p1–c3p7 copied verbatim with course labels
  changed and a CLONED PAGE banner (the phonetics-protocol pages cannot be
  regenerated, see C04 ledger); every sentence's plain text was checked
  against the C05 rows at copy time (21/21 match) and the layer gates
  re-derive every span against the C05 rows on each run.
- **22 and 23: corpus markers.** 22: wylie = the English running head,
  english = the Course V syllabus (531 chars, complete). 23: wylie = FOLIO
  REFERENCES ("127a, 147b-148b, 174a-174b"), english = the Reading Six
  heading and reading list, cut at the 1,500 cap (E-107). Hand-built
  marker blocks per the E-071 protocol, unpaired clause, no pairs.
- **24–511: Abhidharma.** Vasubandhu's *Treasure House of Knowledge*
  (chos mngon pa mdzod, Abhidharmakosha) root verses with the First Dalai
  Lama Gendun Drup's commentary *Illumination of the Path to Freedom*
  (mdzod Tik thar lam gsal byed), chapter IV (karma), plus Changkya's
  *Schools of Philosophy* (24–26) and Chandrakirti/Kedrup on emptiness and
  karma (Reading Six). 156 rows carry double-shad verse lineation `, ,`
  (root verses quoted inside the commentary, often prefixed with a bracketed
  verse number like `[iv.179-80]` — apparatus, not Tibetan); GMR renders the
  verses as capitalised English lines. Row headings ("Reading Two Subject: …")
  fused onto the English of rows 96, 118, 145, 206, 241, 314, 377, 411, 467
  (registered following-heading class — do not file). Row 30–31 carry the
  Sanskrit title in Tibetanised ACIP (`aa bhi dharma ko Sha kA ri kA`).
  Row 219's English is cut at the 1,500 cap (E-107; note, do not file).
  Median wylie length 222 chars, max 756. Parallel witnesses: C16 shares
  263 byte-identical rows (same file re-ingested, NOT independent); C15 54,
  C18 13, C09 9, C17 6.

## Gates
The seventeen standing gates plus `no_supplied_span_head`, which for
`pages_c05` refuses any d=5/d=7 English span beginning with
the/a/an/and/or/his/our/your/I/you unless `data/alignment/span_head_allow.json`
lists it under `pages_c05` with the Tibetan word that licenses it.

## Progress
c5p1–c5p7 (1–21) cloned 2026-09-05; c5p8–c5p49 (22–147) landed 2026-09-05. Coverage 147/511 (17 gates green at every landing; pages_c05 0 unlicensed function-word span heads).

### Batches C05-8 … C05-15 (C05:22–45) — 2026-09-05 — propose: Opus 5 · reconcile/refute: Fable 5.1

First proposed batches of the course: 22 segments (22 and 23 are hand-built
markers), 44 proposals, 44/44 exited 0; 22 reconciled specs, 22/22 exited 0
first run. Pages c5p8–c5p15 wrapped and registered; coverage 45/511; layer
6,484 headwords / 13,661 pairs; 17 gates green; `no_supplied_span_head`
reports **0** function-word-initial d5/d7 spans in pages_c05.

**Course shape confirmed on the ground.** C16 rows are byte-identical
re-ingests of most C05 prose (C16:677–697 ↔ C05:25–48), so no C16 match is
an independent witness. Row 29 carries the outline vocabulary ("an
explanation of" ×4) that GMR supplied; the reconciler nulled `don` ×3 and
`'chad pa` rather than bank "explanation" on `don` (Rule 10). Row 30's
phonetic title ("Chu Ngunpay Dzu Kyi Tsikleur Jepa") was NOT banked at d=5
even though the capitalisation exemption would let it pass: GMR supplies the
real English in the same sentence, so a phonetic d=5 link would enter the
bank as a false equivalent; the bracketed translation was linked instead.
Row 36's closing clause ("here first comes the obeisance of the translator.
*********") has no Tibetan under it (the wylie ends at `'chad do`) — left
unwrapped, published reading per C16:685.

**Rule 10 rulings (banked with notes).** 24 `gsung` → "written" (not
"written by"); 28 agentive `kyis` → ∅ (the "by" belongs to the passive
frame) — CORRECTION 2026-09-05: 27 (`gyis`) was in fact BANKED → "by" (checked
in alignment_full_v1.json: s27p1 d=6 gyis→by; s28p1 kyis→∅); 146 followed 27
(gyis/kyis → "by" ×2). The two rulings conflict; agentive "by" at d=6 is an
OPEN ITEM FOR ADAM (d=6 particles do not enter the dictionary harvest, so no
headword is affected either way); 31 `zhes pa'o` → ∅ (not "translates as"), `ni` → ∅; 32
`skad` → ∅ (not "name"); 34 `tshong` → ∅ (trade, not "merchants"; both
analysts had banked it); 35 `'di tsam` split flat, `thad log` → ∅; 36 the
"Why" questions → ∅ (GMR recast purpose-statements as questions); 39 `gang
gis` → ∅ (scaffolding); 41 `rgyu` → ∅ / `byung` → ∅ (converses produced by
GMR's restructuring, both analysts had banked them); 44 `nas` → ∅; 45 `bcas`
→ ∅ (comitative; GMR's "and" rests on `dang` at 47); 46 `bshad` → ∅ (not
"promised"). 47 `chos can` → "Consider" per the C04 convention.

**Errata.** 24 `mtshung med` (ACIP MTSUNG MED) for `mtshungs med` —
TIBETAN_SPELLING, LOW/PROBABLE, no witness anywhere in 42,199 rows, skeptic
passed. 39 `bnas drug pa` for `gnas drug pa` — illegal syllable, skeptic
passed, confidence raised to CERTAIN. 38 lower-case sentence start after a
closing quotation (`stain." the first two`) — first skeptic REFUTED the
record because its evidence called C16:687 byte-identical when C16:687 in
fact reads "The" (capital); evidence corrected to name C16:687 as a
DIFFERING witness and re-sent to a second skeptic (pending at this entry).
31 `ko Sha`/`ko ShA` mixed vowel length within one row — dropped by the
reconciler (cannot be shown to be a keying defect rather than the
blockprint's own variation); WYLIE queue candidate.

**Shape notes.** 37 banked `gnas gang na` → "in each of the eight" at d=3
with no members (phrase-level, outside the dictionary harvest) because "the
eight" substitutes for `gnas` rather than translating it. 51's English-first
analyst had to abandon the flat shape ("formless" ×2) — reconciler to rule.

### Batches C05-16 … C05-49 (C05:46–147) — 2026-09-05 — propose: Opus 5 · reconcile/refute: Fable 5.1

**Text.** 46–147 is Gendun Drup's commentary on Abhidharmakosha IV
(deeds: the movements of the mind, communicating/non-communicating form,
the vows, virtue/non-virtue/neutral, the three kinds of experience),
with root-verse lines under `[iv.NNN]` apparatus and fused
"Reading… Subject:" headings on 96, 118, 145 (registered, not filed).
C16 parallel rows are byte-identical re-ingests, not witnesses.

**Conventions settled in this stretch.**
- `chos can` → "Consider" only; null wherever GMR's frame is "let us take"
  / "First take" / "Next consider" (129 banked "take" on the one row where
  "take" is the whole exponent).
- `sogs` / `la sogs pa` owns only the closing gesture ("and the like",
  "and so on", "and the rest", "and the other types" at 152; "including"
  at 149); GMR's supplied noun stays unwrapped. Every such span head is
  allowlisted in span_head_allow.json with the `sogs` licensor
  (s96w7, s99w17, s99w20, s112w3, s124w12, s128w6, s140w3/w6/w11; 150 and
  152 at their landing).
- `zhe na` → "you may ask" (s78w11) and `yang na` → "or else" (s81w7)
  allowlisted as licensed hinge heads.
- `yin` / `yin pa` copula nulled (14:1 across the stretch).
- Negative affix: `mi` → "un" (unshifting) subword; `ma yin pa` / `mi` →
  "non" inside hyphenated "non-virtuous"/"non-merit" banked as d=7 without
  the subword flag (hyphen-delimited, so not a broken word; C01 c1p05
  precedent; 106, 147, 149). "non" is outside the four listed forms —
  OPEN ITEM FOR ADAM alongside the fifth form in TODO.md.
- `rnam par rig byed` → "communicating form" as one d=5 dictionary unit;
  `sems pa` → "movements of the mind" (HGM gloss); `nyid dgos` banked
  verbatim with the spelling erratum (E-167).
- Phonetic title at 30 not banked at d=5 (phonetics protocol).

**Rule 10 rulings (nulled with notes).** GMR converses/restructurings:
`rgyu` (→ "result" frame), `byung`, `gsungs`, `'jog`, `'khor du`, `ces
bya`, `bshad` → "promised"; outline vocabulary GMR supplies (`don` →
"explanation", `rang bzhin` → "definition", `bstan`/`bshad` →
"introduction"/"treatment", `gnyis pa` → "two" at 150); `thogs pa med pa`
is not "ineffable"; `seng ldeng` is not "sandalwood" (nulled; E-169
English record for GMR's ruling); `mi 'phrod pa` is not "poisonous";
`de dag` → "their" (151, possessive recast of the demonstrative); `byed`
→ "helps" and `skyed pa` → "brings" (145, causative auxiliaries pinned to
GMR's frame); `'gyur ba` → "lead to" (150, auxiliary of the vedanīya
frame `myong bar 'gyur`) — and 149's `'gyur` → "lead to", which its
reconciler had banked on HGM's glossary, was NULLED AT LANDING for
consistency with 150 (landing note on the page). `tshal pa` → "thorn"
KEPT at 92 and 95 with a caveat (OPEN ITEM FOR ADAM: if ruled false,
re-cut 92/95).

**Errata.** E-154 … E-177 filed after skeptic passes (rows 24, 38, 39, 63,
65, 68, 71, 73, 83, 84, 86, 89, 90×2, 92×2, 112, 115×2, 116, 120, 122,
123, 142). Refuted and dropped: 38's first wording (C16:687 carries the
capital; re-filed corrected as E-155), 74 `rjod` (present stem of brjod),
77 both claims (MOO = au encoding; "Wisdom's" is "is"), 114 `ma tshang pa`
(attested variant), 144 "neither … or" (GMR's habitual construction, 26
tight-window correlatives across eight texts — authorial, not a segment
erratum; at most a corpus-wide style query for GMR). Not filed: E-111
row-boundary spills at 59/60; the hyphen-space line-break class; 219's
1,500-cap (ahead). merge_errata refused three records whose `found`
carried analysts' parenthetical annotations — `found` must be a verbatim
substring; the filer now strips them.

**Gate note.** `no_supplied_span_head` matched Tibetan `the tshom` at
s88w12 (column blindness; allowlisted as GATE FALSE POSITIVE; fix in
TODO.md).

**Models.** Propose Claude Opus 5 (two angles per row); reconcile and
refute Claude Fable 5.1 throughout, including the relaunches after the
2026-09-05 rate-limit kills (95, 99, 101) — never moved off Fable.
